Learn as I Write the Docs

## Intro

Throughout the past few months writing docs, here's one thing I learned about myself. I learn by writing docs. I mean, some people may learn by, say, solving problems. I do that too. Although, I find myself learning more by writing docs.

And to be precise, I learn by sharing with others about a topic. This gets us something called the Feynman technique.

Does everybody know this person? This is Richard Feynman. Feynman was a physicist at California Institute of Technology. His is, even up till today, widely known by his Feynman notes on physics, which is not written by him, but his lecture notes transcribed. These books secured my degree - - because my major requires some higher level physics classes which I wasn't very good at. And Feynman's notes are written so sensibly that I not only ended up passing, getting a good score, but also liking physics quite a lot.

Feynman was a Nobel Laureate for his work in Quantum Physics. Although, he is perhaps even more prominently recognized for his invention of Feynman diagram.

The Feynman diagram does not state any theorems, instead it is a notational tool to help people visualize rather complex physics ideas intuitively.

In fact, this becomes a contribution highly recognized by the science community because it helps people understand physics better. So such contribution does not only extend to helping unrelated people like me to pass our degrees, but the whole community in a large sense.

Feynman advocates his way of learning that is now referred to as the “Feynman technique”.

### The Feynman Technique

- Choose a concept
- Teach it to a toddler
- Identify gaps and go back to the source material
- Review and simplify

Writing docs is this process repeated over and over in micro cycles until the docs are perfect.

## What exactly do we learn as we write the docs

Even writing basic tutorials forces us to dive deep and systematically into the topics.

[Basic Tutorial (React Redux)](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/basic-tutorial)

Intended to be as a step-by-step guide to first time users

Problems encountered:

- do we want to use action creators?
- do we maintain a normalized store, or a big array of objects?
- do we use switch statements?
- what's the best practice for React Redux?should we talk about Redux? (cuz a lot of people confuse the two and thought Redux is doing the work RR is doing or vice versa)

Persistently staying with the problem gets you more expertise in the field

When you solve problems, you can stop once you find the answer to that specific problem. It's a bottom-up approach and it is very short-lived.

When you write the docs, before you put those words down to paper, in this case up on the site, you want to make sure you are saying the right thing. So you want to explain what connect does, you will have to read the sourcecode until you have certain level of confidence that you are not bullshitting things out based on your own imagination.

It's a top-down approach. And one higher layer of understanding will encourage you to go even one more layer up.

> I don't know anything, but I do know that everything is interesting if you go into it deeply enough.

– Richard Feynman

Maintaining whatever you are learning makes you become the "go-to" person of that field.

## How to get better at writing docs

There are two tips:

- Motivation
- Intuition

Technical documentation closes the gap between implementation and intuition.

When you try to either explain things to others, or try to “simplify” your language, the trick I find useful is to think of this process as closing the gap between (mostly imperical) implementation and intuition.

And better off, stay close with the intuition side.

( did not have time to expand due to context )

## How to *actually* get started

### Official docs of OS projects that you use and care about

It's great if you see some projects have maintainers willing to help with docs.

Most likely they are very familiar with the subject matter already, but may not have the time to do the actual doc writing. Because it really takes a lot of time.

Reach out and say you're willing to help. Docs tasks are less popular in general. Then, read the doc pieces and posts that the maintainers have already written. Pick out the content that is relavant and phrase them in ways that suits doc setting.

Proofread carefully, avoid grammar errors.

**Secret: You don't need to be an expert before contributing to doc**

Document as you learn the subject matter. You're closest to your confusionsYou perfect your learning. A lot of thought leaders would agree with this:

- Kyle Simpson, a.k.a. Getify, the guy who wrote You Don't Know JS, wrote another book on functional programming as he learned the subject.

But they probably won't tell you that not all scenarios fit in this category. You need to be a bit strategic in your choice of topic.

Great choices

- Tutorials
- API references
- Intuitive understanding
- Motivations

Maybe not that great

- Best practices
- Specific use cases

### Create and maintain your own

**Secret: Be consistent and outspoken**

I was learning about Flow and I've been intentionally very outspoken about it, despite the fact that I am normally very very private. I was learning about call properties and I pulled up a PR on it. Then people came in and pointed out what I wrote was wrong (like I wasn't familiar with TypeScript), and taught me things I never learned about. Particularly interesting was some insight regarding the nature of JavaScript which I would not have read anywhere unless one of the discussions included an example that reveals the intuition behind it.

Most people don't generate content as they learn. I don't know a specific proportion but it is very low. The ratio to initiate generating content is even fewer.

But if you are the person who initiates generating stuff, people will come and tell you about things they know.

I mean, people constantly tell other people about things they know, but if you start generating stuff, that becomes a node where people will start commenting on.

Especially, people will tell you when they spot your mistakes. It will take some getting used to cuz your day to day interaction people tend to avoid that.

**Secret: You can always write blogs**

Not for others, for yourself.

You'll feel the benefit after you start writing the blogs.

- interesting reactions
- learn about your own writing, your own tone
- sth you know about and people constantly asking you about, you have a blog post, then just send them the link lor
- most importantly, you learn the subject better as you write

### It's golden advice :)))))

> If you feel like you’ve learned something in the past few years I deeply recommend starting a blog, if only to catalog your thoughts
